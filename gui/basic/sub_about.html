Open Post Box is a crowsourced snail mail postbox search application. You can use it for searching the postboxes in India. 

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I have been using instgram a lot. If you follow me on instagram you would have noticed pictures of postboxes. If you check the details they all have a similar tagging pattern. They all are tagged with #openbangalore #postbox and #pin
&lt;pin_code&gt;. The last tag #pin&lt;pin_code&gt; in real will look like #pin560100. All these pictures belong to my secret project called postboxes.<br>
<p class="pull-right"><img src="http://thejeshgn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/post_box.jpg" width="300px" class="imgleft"></p>
I like sending post cards. It’s such a pain to send post card because its difficult to find a postbox. There aren’t many these days. So for last few months I had been taking geo tagged pictures thinking one day I will clean them up. But that never happened.</pin_code></p>
<p>But then instagram gave me an option to collect and organize this data in a fun way. I jumped into it. So now I instagram a post box with #openbangalore #postbox and #pin&lt;pin_code&gt;. I also geo tag them. I have a script which uses the instagram API and pulls the image url,Tags, Location, Time, User credits out of it. Cleans up that data and inserts into a SQLite database.<br>
<br>
Now I am waiting for the database to build. I am planning to write a web app where you can search for a postbox depending on location or pincode. Of course I will make the DB available at <a href="http://openbangalore.org/" title="Open Bangalore">OpenBangalore</a> once we reach minimum data.</p>
